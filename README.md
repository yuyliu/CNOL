# CNOL
The China National Linguistics Olympiad (CNOL, aka IOLC for "International Linguistics Olympiad, China") is the contest through which Team China of the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is chosen, and has been held annually since 2012. 
"CN" is the ISO 3166 country code for China and "OL" is deliberately chosen not to correspond to the name of the contest in Chinese or in English.

Each year, high school linguists living or studying in China compete to solve linguistic problems covering descriptive, mathematical, and theoretical linguistics at CNOL. 
No prior knowledge of linguistics or second languages is required to participate in this contest.

This repository posts the problem and solution sets in Chinese and in English (within the "PDFs" folder), as well as a template of their source code (within the "TEXs" folder), for CNOL (since 2020).
For further information about CNOL (e.g., FAQs, announcements, registration, etc.), visit [the CNOL website](http://www.ioling.org.cn) or [the International Teenager Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC) website](http://www.it3c.org).
## Problem Committee
The preparation of the problem set for CNOL, just like for IOL, is a complex and time-consuming task, involving composition, testing and review of problems in Chinese and in English.
That is the duty of the CNOL Problem Committee (PC).
The CNOL PC is a body composed of people studying in different countries and at different institutions, whose expertise in linguistic problems has been demonstrated by authorship or high scores at past CNOLs, APLOs, or IOLs.
