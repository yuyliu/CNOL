# CNOL
The China National Linguistics Olympiad (CNOL) is the contest through which Team China of the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is chosen, and has been held annually since 2012. 
Each year, high school linguists living or studying in China compete to solve linguistic problems covering descriptive, mathematical, and theoretical linguistics. 
No prior knowledge of linguistics or second languages is required to participate in this contest.

This repository posts the source code and output pdfs for the problem and solution sets, in Chinese and in English, of the CNOL since 2020.
For other information about the CNOL (e.g., FAQs, announcements, registration, etc.), visit [the CNOL website](http://www.ioling.org.cn), [the International Teenager Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC) website](http://www.it3c.org), or the ITCCC WeChat Official Account.
